    <h2>Karen is the pet name of my cat and as a cat owner i would like to share some hints on how to help your cat cope
        with visitors</h2>

    <p>It is a lot more than visible signs they are there. It is often more subtle scent, or less subtle urine spraying,
        but all of these are indicators that your cat is under pressure from a not-so-friendly feline neighbour</p>

    <ol>
        <li>First of all, take a good look at where your cat likes to wander. How does your cat get in and out of the
            house? Are other cats peering in, and if so, where? What times of day does your cat like to leave the house,
            and most of all, does your cat have any toileting issues in the house, because this is often a sign that
            they are too stressed to leave their home</li>

        <li>Next, change everything you can to give your cat places to hide, sneak past any staring eyes, and to avoid
            conflict. This can be as simple as adding large pots around your cat flap or back door, so that your cat can
            exit the home and hide quickly while they look around to make sure the other cat is not about. If there is
            an exit you know they are likely to prefer, try to start using this instead</li>


        <li>-In the garden itself, add extra routes from the house to wherever your cat likes to go. This might be extra
            shrubs to provide screening, or could be trellis or fencing that your cat can climb.</li>

        <li>Cats usually prefer to be higher up and will feel safer having a vantage point. However, do not place these
            where a visiting cat can sit and stare at yours! Closer to your own house so that your cat can peer out is
            better</li>

        <li>Even old dog kennels or any structure where your cat can have little peep holes to see out of while they
            stay inside work well.</li>

        <li>If the neighbouring cat is staring into your home, buy some cling window frosting film. You just place this
            onto the glass. It is not sticky, but it does filter out any staring and this will help your cat have a more
            settled time indoors! It is easy to get online and is very cheap, and doesn it leave a mark.</li>
